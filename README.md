Movie Review Website

Our project is a dynamic web-based application designed to allow users to explore, review, and rate movies. This project aims to provide a platform where users can view movie information, read feedback from other viewers, and contribute their own opinions. It uses XAMPP via PhpMyAdmin as its database integration.
